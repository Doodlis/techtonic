      <p>Essay example : "The Campground by the Lake Tahoe" by Doodlis</p>
      <p>I have been fascinated by the nature and its exquisite diversity around the globe since the early days of my
        existence. In all my travels I fell in love with many places and cherished the natures’ magnificence around us.
        No exception was my camping trip in the region of Lake Tahoe. It is an oasis of serenity, a paradise on Earth, a
        marbled jewel with breathtaking views, sounds, and smells.

      <p>The morning begins bright and early, unveiling sensational sights from the murkiness of the night. Golden
        sunshine piercing through our miniature, chartreuse tent fades away my vivid dreams, and softly whispers to
        awaken and delve into strikingly picturesque outdoors. Our meager tent was set up under the tremendous, jade
        green pine tree, with spreading crowns and gigantic, woody pine cones, with pointy scales that open to release
        its minuscule seeds. The shady, bumpy, and sinuous pathway meanders its way through a luscious and spinous
        forest eventually leading to the lake. The woodlands’ floor is covered with a blanket of sumptuous moss, ranging
        in appearance from vibrant green tint to chalky tone of faded emerald. Once the forest allows more sunlight to
        pass through its vast canopy, sights of aquamarine hue appear between the lessen amount of towering tree trunks.
        The skyline-silver lake emerges as we conquer the last strip of a lengthy trail. The lake resembles a perfectly
        flat metal disc, peaceful and statue still. In addition, the crystal-clear water basin is lined with gargantuan,
        ashen colored mountains gloriously preserving their frosted pearl ice caps even in the warmth of the summer. An
        extensive span of cloudless, turquoise sky hovers above the massive peaks. The idyllic scenery took my breath
        away</p>

      <p>The morning’s tranquility turns into midday buzz as the nature, wildlife, and campers transition from drowsy to
        wide-awake. Out on the lake, a shoal of shimmering, silver-scaled fish are jumping out of the water for a chance
        to catch a small part of a squadron of humming insects flying just above the surface; as they land back on the
        water, the splashing sounds permeate the air. Consequently, numerous ripples simultaneously clash on the mirror
        like coating of the lake, moving up and down in a circular pattern, producing a pleasing rhythm. Muted, squeaky
        noises of squirrels feasting on pine cones fade away between the trees. In a distance, muffled conversations and
        cheerful, high-pitched giggles can be heard on the woodland’s pathway. Faint sounds of crunching leaves and
        snapping sticks under the feet of globetrotters’ twist into a rumbling march. Raucous and earsplitting screams
        of playing kids surround the lake. As the evening is nearing, soft and melodious chirps of the red cardinals
        transition into blaring yodels of the loons. Gentle, mellow tunes of the guitar are accompanied by the crackling
        sounds of the flaming bonfire. The campground noises are both infuriatingly distracting and extremely
        intoxicating at the same time.</p>

      <p>The evening mist emphasizes halcyonic odors in the camp zone. The fresh, balmy, and crisp smell of pine tree
        needles lingers in the air. Similarly, there is a musky and earthy aroma of soggy lumber, that mingles
        throughout the area. The sharp and pungent whiff of a burning matchstick enters my nostrils and quickly
        dissipates. The slightly hazy odor of wood smoke seeps into the camp from a smoldering fire. While cravingly
        waiting for the dinner, spicy and gamy aroma of sizzling lamb chops reaches my nose, before the food has a
        chance to reach my mouth. The mouthwatering, delicate, and sweet scent of blistering marshmallows and bitter
        aroma of a melting dark chocolate drifts in the breeze. All these soothing scents and aromas make me feel calm,
        comfortable, and relaxed.</p>

        in Lake Tahoe. There is no time to contemplate dilemmas or worry about troubles. This is the time to recline on
        the dense grass, relax, and absorb the charming artistry of the nature, as well as, engage in pleasant
