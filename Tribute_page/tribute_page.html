        <p>Sylvia Alice Earle is an American marine biologist, explorer, lecturer, and author of books and documentaries. She is a leading oceanographer and former first female chief scientist of the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. She was one of the first underwater explorers to make use of a modern self-contained underwater breathing apparatus to identify numerous species of marine life. Also, Earle participates in groups, such as Ocean Elders, which are devoted to protecting the ocean and its wildlife. Her numerous achievements sparked world-wide interest in protection of the oceans, and lead to a higher participation of women in science programs.</p>
        <p>Sylvia Alice Earle was born in Gibbstown, New Jersey on August 30, 1935. She is one of three children born to an electrical engineer Lewis Reade Earle and his wife, Alice Freas Richie. Earle grew up on a small farm, where her interest for the wonders of nature began; both of her parents showed affinity for living organisms. The family moved to Dunedin, Florida in 1947, when she was 12 years-old. They owned a waterfront property, which provided the opportunity for Sylvia Earle to explore nearby areas of flooded coastal grasslands and sea beds, and investigate its inhabitants. According to the article “Meet an Underwater Explorer” by Woelflein, as a child “Sylvia spent hundreds of hours playing there in the warm, clear waters of the Gulf of Mexico. ‘Wearing a mask, I would float for hours face-down on an inner tube, just watching’” (10). Her interest in marine biology continued throughout her teenage years and lead to education in this field. In 1955, Earle received her Bachelor of Science degree from Florida State University; where she also learned to dive using SCUBA gear. She continued her education in botany and wrote her master’s thesis work on algae in the Gulf of Mexico in 1956. After completing her doctorate of phycology in 1966, she published her dissertation Phaeophyta of the Easter Gulf of Mexico in 1969.</p>
        <p>Immediately after receiving her Ph.D., Sylvia Earle accepted a position as the resident director of the Cape Haze Marine Laboratory. The next year she moved to Massachusetts and accepted dual role at Harvard University and Radcliffe Institute as a research scholar. Even though her academic career was stimulating, her heart was in the ocean and the life within it. In one article by Nancy Gibbs, Earle says “I was a scientist at Harvard when I noticed a paper on the bulletin board asking if anyone would be interested in living underwater as a scientist for two weeks in the U.S. Virgin Islands…The men were called aquanauts. The women, we were aqua-babes, aqua-chicks, aqua-naughties. But we didn't care what they called us, as long as we had a chance to go” (70). The Tektite Project was an installation fifty feet below the surface of the sea that allowed scientist to explore underwater realm, test viability of deep-water habitats, and health effects of living undersea for prolonged periods of time. In 1969, she was rejected from the first all-male project, but the next year she was selected as the leader of the first all-female team for the Tektite II. She was named researcher in 1975. Earle moved to San Francisco in 1976 and became the curator of the California Academy of Sciences. She got her name as a fellow in botany at the Natural History Museum, University of California, Berkeley.</p>
        <p>Earle was one of the first researchers to use SCUBA equipment while observing numerous marine organisms and plants, and identifying new species; also, she discovered undersea dunes off the coast of Bahamas. Although, the world record of the deepest dive to a depth of 1,250 feet belongs to her, she thought that SCUBA and JIM equipment had limitations for studying deep-sea marine life. Earle together with her former husband, Graham Hawkes, designed submersible craft that to this day operates in ocean depths reaching 3,000 feet, and helps to broaden the knowledge about deep ocean environment. In 1990, Earle was the first woman to occupy chief scientist position at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and spiked women participation in science programs and higher positions. She was the first to criticize America’s lack of funding for deep-sea environmental studies. Eventually, she received attention from the governments around the world; to this day she collaborates on many projects dedicated to ocean technologies and science. Earle is the founder of Mission Blue, a non-profit foundation for protecting and exploring the Earth's ocean. In addition to publishing numerous scientific papers, books, and documentaries on marine life and threats of pollution, Earle is an active advocate of public education concerning the importance of the oceans as a crucial natural habitat. In her essay “The Sweet Spot in Life: Why the Ocean Matters to Everyone, Everywhere”, Earle writes “Earthlings take for granted that the world is blue, embraced by an ocean that harbors most of the life on the planet…and otherwise tends to hold the planet steady - a friendly place in a universe of inhospitable options” (65-66).</p>
        <p>Earle’s dedication to marine exploration and leadership of numerous undersea expeditions over her career increased government’s support for oceanography studies as well as society’s interest in protecting the oceans and its wildlife. She had a great influence on women’s roles in science when it was mainly occupied by men. Throughout her oceanographic research career, Earle earned numerous titles, such as “Her Deepness” by the New Yorker, “Living Legend” by the Library of Congress, and a “Hero for the planet” by Time magazine. Her contributions to better understand the deep-sea environment and scientific publications helped to raise awareness concerning the importance of the changing ocean’s habitats, overfishing, and pollution. </p>
