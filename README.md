### Introduction to Basic HTML and HTML5
**Create a Form Element**
- I have struggled to nest text field inside a form element,
 sipmly because I wrote: "<form action="/submit cat photo"" 
without > before starting input line.  

**Override Class Declarations by Styling ID Attributes**
- "#orange-text;
  {color:orange;}" 
  I could not understand why this command wasn't overriding 
class declarations, until I saw my mistake - ";" after "#orange-text" .

**JavaScript**
- I have struggled with JavaScript quite a bit. At the begginign it was mostly due 
to such a loose language, it was hard to understantd what is the actual JavaScript syntax,
 what's just plain English languge that can be anything.
